# Introduction

The DS Vaadin Flow Gradle plugin allows you to build your Vaadin projects leveraging the Gradle build tool. 

It's main purpose is to seamlessly integrate with the Gradle build ecosystem and provide the developer with an easy
interface to build complex Vaadin Flow applications.

The main features include:

  * First class support for Java, Groovy and Kotlin Vaadin projects [todo-link]
  * Support for using Yarn and Bower for managing Javascript components [todo-link]
  * Includes project creator tasks for automatically generating stubs for projects, components and themes [todo-link]
  * Support for theming with CSS and SASS [todo-link]
  * Production mode support [todo-link]
  * IDE support for both Intellij IDEA and Eclipse [todo-link]


The plugin also integrates with many of Gradles optimization features such as:

  * Gradle Build Cache [todo-link]
  * Gradle Parallel Execution [todo-link]
  * Gradle Offline mode [todo-link]
  * Long running Gradle Deamon builds [todo-link]


Furthermore, the plugin provides advanced Javascript features such as:

  * Offline mirroring for Javascript components [todo-link]
  * Transpilation for older browsers (IE11) [todo-link]


The plugin also tries to support most of the features the Vaadin Maven Flow plugin does. However, it does not guarantee that all features are implementated or that they are implemented in the same way.
