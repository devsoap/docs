# Javascript and Web Components

One of the biggest changes in Vaadin Flow compared to Vaadin Framework 8 is the change from using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to
using web components. For previous Vaadin developers this brings a lot of new terminology to learn and a lot of new Javascript
framework tools, mostly known to frontend developers, to handle and manage.

The Gradle plugin tries to mitigate the JS tool bloat by allowing you to work with web component dependencies just as you would
do with standard Maven dependencies.

This section will introduce how you can manage add any Javascript component to your project and manage those just as you would
with your Maven dependencies.
